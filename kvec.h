/*
    module  : kvec.h
    version : 1.4
    date    : 06/22/20

 1. Change type of n, m from size_t to unsigned. Reason: takes less memory.
 2. Remove (type*) casts. Reason: not needed for C.
 3. Replace sizeof(type) with sizeof(*a). Reason: no need to specify type.
 4. Remove kv_a. Reason: compiler complains about lvalue required.
 5. Rename kv_A to kv_at. Reason: looks like a better name.
 6. Remove roundup32. Reason: not used anymore.
 7. Change initial value of m to 1 instead of 2. Reason: takes less memory.
 8. Change vector type to pointer. Reason: more convenient to pass around.
 9. Remove protection against multiple inclusion. Reason: it must be possible
    to have vectors of different types within the same source file. Undone.
10. Remove stdlib.h. Reason: it should be possible to have different memory
    allocaters for different vectors.
11. Protect kv_size against NULL parameter. Reason: more convenient interface.
12. Change type from kvec_t to vector. Reason: _t is in the compiler namespace.
13. Change memory allocator to mem_malloc and mem_realloc. Reason: this allows
    those vectors to be garbage collected.
14. Add macros stk_init and stk_push. Reason: they allow checks on NULL pointer
    and statistics.
15. Change prefix kv_ into vec_. Reason: easier when changing existing code.
16. Add macro vec_setsize. Reason: vec_size cannot be used for this purpose.
17. Add vec_back macro. Reason: sometimes a value needs to be read, not popped.
18. Macro vec_pushp is not used. Maybe it should be removed? Done.
19. Add automatic initialization in vec_push. Reason: more convenient interface.
20. Add macro vec_equal. Reason: part of the requirements of the vector type.
21. Add macro vec_reverse. Reason: more convenient than as function.
22. Add automatic initialization in vec_copy. Reason: more convenient interface.
23. Rename vec_resize to vec_grow. Reason: vector can only grow.
24. Add vec_shrink macro. Reason: reduce memory footprint of large vectors.
25. Add vec_end macro. Reason: can be used as stack pointer.
26. Use GC_malloc and GC_realloc. Reason: simpler interface.
27. Remove stk_ macros. Reason: Two different memory allocators is confusing.

  2008-09-22 (0.1.0):
	* The initial version.
