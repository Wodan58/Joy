This is a distribution of [Joy1](https://github.com/Wodan58/joy1).
All modifications done in that fork make it difficult to see what the original
version was.
[Joy](http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/euroforth/ef01/thun01.pdf) is a
decent language and needs a ditto
[presentation](http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/euroforth/ef01/thomas01a.pdf).

Changes
-------

All changes done in Joy1 have been undone. Some changes were done that make the
build environment happy. The only new thing is a portable makefile, following
this [advice](http://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/08/20).
There is something different in these sources compared to the ones that can be
downloaded from the original [site](http://www.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/research/research-projects/past-projects/joy-programming-language) and
that is the comments at the start of main.c and of interp.c.
[Manfred von Thun](http://fogus.me/important/von-thun/) really wanted those
comments in main.c, but the
[newsgroup](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/concatenative/info) did not
allow attachments, so it was never published. As for the comments in interp.c,
I added them because I like some version history. It proves that the language
and the implementation was not done during one night. In fact, according to
this [interview](http://archive.vector.org.uk/art10000350) the implementation
in C was started in 1995.

Installation
------------

The [BDW garbage collector](https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc) can be installed
and used but Joy can operate without; that is both easier and faster.

Binaries
--------

The binary `joy` is the original from 2003 and still works under Linux;
`joy.exe` was compiled by me in 2005 and should still work under Windows;
both use the BDW garbage collector.
