This is the NOBDW version of [Joy1](https://github.com/Wodan58/joy1).
The two versions are drifting apart.
[Joy](http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/euroforth/ef01/thun01.pdf) is a
decent language and needs a ditto
[presentation](http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/euroforth/ef01/thomas01a.pdf). The original version can be seen [here](https://github.com/Wodan58/joy0).

Changes
-------

Some changes were done that make ~the build environment~ me happy. One new
thing is a portable makefile, following this [advice](http://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/08/20).
There is something different in these sources compared to the ones that can be
downloaded from the archived [original](http://web.archive.org/web/20030602190407/https://www.latrobe.edu.au/philosophy/phimvt/joy.html) and that is the
comments at the start of main.c and of interp.c.
[Manfred von Thun](http://fogus.me/important/von-thun/) really wanted those
comments in main.c, but the newsgroup did not allow attachments, so it was
never published.
As for the comments in interp.c, I added them because I like some version
history. It proves that the language and the implementation was not done over
night.
In fact, according to this [interview](http://archive.vector.org.uk/art10000350)
the implementation in C was started in 1995.

Build instructions
------------------

    cd build
    SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1047920271 cmake ..
    cmake --build .

There is a customized version of usrlib.joy waiting in the build directory.

Testing
-------

    cd test2
    for i in *.joy
    do
      ../build/joy $i >$i.out
    done
    grep -l false *.out

There are some false positives.

Bugs
----

This implementation of Joy has the intent to stay as close to the legacy
version as possible. All unintended deviations and all remaining bugs are
